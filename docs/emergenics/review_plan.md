# Emergenics Emergence Engineering Review Plan

This plan mirrors the ArqonBus review approach but is scoped to Emergenics’ `Emergence_Engineering` work and how we reuse it here.

---

## 0. Emoji Legend

- ✅ reviewed (reflected where relevant)
- 🟡 in_progress (partially read / mid‑reflection)
- ⏳ queued (identified but not yet read)

---

## 1. Objectives

- Build a **clear map** of the Emergence_Engineering space as it relates to:
  - Emergent substrates and solvers.
  - Controllers and feedback mechanisms.
  - Datasets and benchmarks.
- Translate key ideas into:
  - `docs/emergenics/constitution.md`
  - `docs/emergenics/specification.md`
  - `docs/emergenics/emergence_engineering.md` (running notes).
- Keep track of what we have read and what remains.

---

## 2. Scope

- Primary source tree (read‑only):
  - `/home/irbsurfer/Projects/Novyte/Emergenics/Engineering/Novel_Systems_Engineering/Emergence_Engineering`

- Local docs in this repo:
  - `docs/emergenics/constitution.md`
  - `docs/emergenics/specification.md`
  - `docs/emergenics/emergence_engineering.md`

---

## 3. Phased Review Strategy

### Phase A — Docs & Lessons (Context First)

Goal: understand the conceptual and methodological spine.

- `Docs/docs/*.md` ✅
- `Docs/lessons/*.md` ✅
- `Docs/messages/*.md` ✅

### Phase B — Demos (Moonshots & Use Cases)

Goal: capture high‑level systems and moonshot patterns.

- `Demos/` ⏳

### Phase C — Core GNLNA & NLCA Engines

Goal: understand the core emergent substrates and their algebra.

- `GNLNA/` ⏳
- `GNLNA_*` subdirs ⏳
- `NLCA_*` subdirs ⏳
- `Algebra_of_Controlled_Emergence/` ⏳

### Phase D — Omega & Hypergraph Structures

Goal: integrate higher‑order cognition/emergence frameworks.

- `The_Omega_Cognition_AGI_Foundations/` ⏳
- `The_Omega_Cogniton/` ⏳
- `The_Omega_Cogniton_Discovery_Engine/` ⏳
- `Hypergraph_Automata_Emergence/` ⏳

## 4. Working Rhythm

For each iteration:

1. **Pick a chunk** (e.g., a few docs, a demo folder).
2. **Read & reflect:**
   - Summarize the chunk.
   - Extract key lessons and potential system impact.
3. **Update local docs:**
   - `emergence_engineering.md` (notes + registry).
   - `constitution.md` (only if principles truly shift).
   - `specification.md` (only for stable operator/controller patterns).
4. **Mark progress here:**
   - Move items from ⏳ → 🟡 → ✅ in the phase lists above.

This keeps the Emergenics review tightly coupled to concrete design artifacts without touching the existing ArqonBus/QHE constitutions and specs.
