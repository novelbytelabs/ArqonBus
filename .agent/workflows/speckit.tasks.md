1. Read the `implementation_plan.md` (or `plan.md`) and the Feature Spec.
2. Generate a `tasks.md` file (if not existing) or update it.
3. Structure tasks into phases:
   - **Phase 1: Setup & Core** (Scaffolding, Entities)
   - **Phase 2: Implementation** (Logic, API, Tests)
   - **Phase 3: Verification** (Integration, Polish)
4. Ensure every task has a unique ID and clear completion criteria.
